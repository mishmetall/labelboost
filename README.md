# labelboost

Tool for semi-supervised machine learning

## What will it do?
- It allows you to train your model in parallel with labelling process
- Updated model can be used to make baseline markup for you
- You see what model actually learns and label only most useful data (ideally)

## Used frameworks
- Qt for GUI
- Tensorflow backend for ML
- imgaug for data augmentation

## TODO list
1. Should have same functions as labelme and labelimg packages
2. Features: edge aligning
3. Contrast-based mask refinement
4. Easy to extend main functionality with plugins, new formats and new model training providers
